# Project 2 Author João Caldeira
This project is a program made in C++ with the objective to calculate the maximum number of residents of a given city that can go to a supermarket without crossing eachothers paths given the current COVID-19 pandemic situation. The problem considers all the cities with a square pattern with straight streets going from East to West or North to South. Therefore the student describes the city in it’s solution as a quadrangular graph with vertex capacities and calculates the maximum flow, using Dinic’s algorithm, of that graph given a super source (the residents) and a super target (the supermarkets). The maximum flow shall be equal to the maximum number of people that can go to the supermarket safely.
