This project is a program made in Processing with the goal to develop a writting technique for smartwatches while minimizing the fat finger problem. The solution helps the user to write the default phrases in the file "phrases.txt" much faster given the problematic interface and finger. This solution uses a keyboard that is based on the English language, which is designed to be the fastest keyboard to type english in a smartwatch as the most frequent letters used are the first letters of the keyboard. The solution also uses predictive text to track down what word is the user typing and get faster times and more intuitive typing.

Final Grade 15/20.
