This project is a program made in Processing with the goal to get the fastest time to click random targets in a square grid of 16 targets. The project had some rules and the group respected them, making the best possible fair version in the groups vision. The solution uses several visual stimulations like the colour to get the best reaction out of the user, and it also uses a bubble cursor to minimize the mistakes and get the shorter distance to target, making the best use of the law of Fitts.

Final Grade 18/20.
